# rpi-4.9.y is default branch on official tree at time of writing
# however, it does not support onboard audio
# The 4.10 branch has audio, but does not have the backport support for VC4
# etc. So, mask the 4.10 kernels for now.
=sys-kernel/bcmrpi3-kernel-bin-4.10*
# 4.11, 4.12 and 4.13 do not support VC4
=sys-kernel/bcmrpi3-kernel-bin-4.11*
=sys-kernel/bcmrpi3-kernel-bin-4.12*
=sys-kernel/bcmrpi3-kernel-bin-4.13*
# 4.14 has VC4 and audio support, and works well, so no longer masked
