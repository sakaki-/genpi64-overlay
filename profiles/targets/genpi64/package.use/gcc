# Build GCC with Link Time Optimization: for a faster compiler via cross-translation unit optimizations
# TODO: This increases the build times for gcc by >4x, with little speedup in the resulting compile times.
# until that's figured out, not worth it.

# Build GCC with Profile Guided Optimization: Requires a profiling step and then an additional compile of the compiler, but the result should be faster.

# Build GCC with zstd compression support: Allow debug symbols to be stored in a compressed format, using zstd
