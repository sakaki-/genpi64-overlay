	Service to enable modifed /boot/config.txt files to be safely
	tried out on the RPi3, by rotating in the old, last-known-good
	version and scheduling an automatic reboot to take place after
	a few minutes delay. The user can elect to keep the modified
	config prior to this reboot, by using the pyconfig_gen
	application (or at the CLI, via the rpi3-keep-config
	script).
