<longdescription>
		twofing is a daemon which runs in the background and
		recognizes two-finger gestures performed on a touchscreen
		and converts them into mouse and keyboard events.

		This way, such gestures can be used in almost all
		existing applications (even ones where you wouldn’t
		expect it, like Wine applications) without having to
		modify them.

		Currently contains udev bindings for the egalax touchscreen,
		and the Raspberry Pi (1,2,3) official 7" touchscreen.
