		WiringPi is a PIN based GPIO access library written in C
		for the BCM2835 used in the Raspberry Pi (1, 2 and 3).
		It’s designed to be familiar to people who have used the
		Arduino “wiring” system.

		A main library, devices library and utility app are included.

		You need to uncomment the relevant features in config.txt to use
		this package (for example, "dtparam=spi=on").

		NB: please note that Gentoo is treated as an unsupported platform
		by upstream; any bug reports sent there will be rejected.
